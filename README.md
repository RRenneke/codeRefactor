# codeRefactor

As a developer, we need to leave code better than we find it. This project took an exciting website. The code was updated for with logical semantic HTML elemenets and the over code is sequential and concise.

AS A marketing agency, I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards, SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
